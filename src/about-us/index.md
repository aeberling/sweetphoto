title1: "MEET TAMMY"
content1: "Hi!  I’m Tammy “Sweetie” –yes, for real, that’s the best, errrrm, maybe *easiest* pronunciation of my last name. As I began to pursue photography professionally, I kept going back to Sweetie, and realized what I loved to capture photographically were “sweet” or maybe better said, sacred moments that happen in the midst of weddings and lifestyle photography sessions. <br><br>
Other than photography, you might find me traveling with my husband (since 2007)~ we love experiencing food, cities, and other cultures together…Or you might find me creating lego structures or drawing with my kiddo, or having a family movie night with the newest MCU release. "
